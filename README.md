# github-practice
A simple repository to explore GitHub's features for commits, branches, and issues.

This repo is associated with my blogpost [Why I love Git and Github](https://javirudolph.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-git-and-github/)

If you have any questions, you can write an [issue](https://github.com/javirudolph/github-practice/issues). 

The goal of using git for version control is that it allows us to keep track of changes and how each user has made changes. No need to save multiple versions of scripts, you can create test branches and merge if your changes are good. 

[Github docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) has a lot of resources to learn how to use a git workflow and communicate with github. If you are an R user, the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Ryan](https://happygitwithr.com/) is one of the best things out there!

## Get Started 

Below, you will find a few tasks that will help you get started with your GitHub journey. 

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one [here]( https://github.com/join). 
2. You can check out this brief article to [start your journey](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git).
3. This [hello-world guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) which will show you how to create a repo and run the basic workflow.

**Did you know you can edit files directly from the GitHub website?** I wouldn't recommend this for running code, but if you need to annotate or include comments on scripts, edit READMEs, etc, the website is a good place to start and get familiar. 

1. As you saw in the [hello-world guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world), create a new branch for this github-practice repo. You can call it [yourname]-branch.
2. Once on your branch, you can find the README.md file and edit it.
3. Commit the changes to your branch.
4. Now that your branch has your changes, open a pull request ([step 4 in the guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#step-4-open-a-pull-request)).
5. Review your changes and create the pull request. This will altert the repo's owner that changes have been made and will check to see if those changes can be merged to the main branch. Once changes are merged, you can safely delete the branch.

YAY! you have created your first pull request!

Now, let's practice commenting on this repo's [first issue](https://github.com/javirudolph/github-practice/issues/4) by heading to that site and following the instructions within the issue thread.
